These are the basic files you need to drop into a project in order to make it
easy to run Statick as part of a Jenkins build.

## Dockerfile
The Dockerfile contains the minimum set of packages and python modules to run
Statick as part of a Jenkins build. You can either copy it into your software's
version control and add the dependencies needed to build your software or you
can inherit from this Dockerfile using a FROM tag in your own Dockerfile.

## Jenkinsfile
As with the Dockerfile, this is a minimum example for how to check out and run
Statick as part of a Jenkins build. It assumes the presence of a valid
Dockerfile and that you have a Jenkins node with the "docker" label. 

## statick_config
You can drop statick_config into your repository and point Statick's
--user-paths argument at that directory in order to override the default
Statick configurations for your repository. Of particular interest is
profile.yaml, which is used to set the default analysis profile for your
repository.
