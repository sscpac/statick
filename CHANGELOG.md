## Unreleased

### Added

### Fixed

### Removed

## v0.3.4 - 2020-02-26

### Added

## v0.3.3 - 2020-02-19

### Added

- Github workflows for Actions.
  These are just starting but they may replace Travis CI in the future.
- Made 3.8 the default version for CI testing.

### Fixed

- Added needed `install_requires` entries in setup.py to allow Statick to work out of the box (in the pip sense).
- The `statick_ws` command now supports running without an output directory.
- The xmllint unit tests will be skipped if xmllint executable is not available.
  This can happen when apt dependencies are not going to be installed.

  It is not getting updates any longer, and is not available on Github Actions.

## v0.3.1 - 2020-02-06

### Added

- Reporting plugin for the
  [Jenkins Warnings Next Generation](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Warnings+Next+Generation+Plugin)
  plugin. (@axydes)
  - Updated Jenkinsfile template to reflect usage of new plugin.
- Renamed file writing reporting plugin to write Jenkins warnings reporting plugin. (@axydes)
- More helpful, explicit error messages from the clang-format tool plugin.

### Fixed

- Not writing log files if no output directory is specified.
- The make tool plugin will now cause Statick to exit with error condition if the tool does not run successfully.

### Removed

## v0.3.0 - 2020-01-31

Note that a breaking change was made to how the output directory is specified for writing results to a file.
The default changed from always writing output files to only writing output files when the `--output-directory`
argument is specified.
The previous way to run Statick was:

```shell
statick my-project statick-output
```

With this update you can run with output files:

```shell
statick my-project --output-directory statick-output
```

or without output files:

```shell
statick my-project
```

### Added

- Skipping integration tests for tool plugins where the tool is not available via pip.
- Statick works better on Ubuntu 18.04. (@kogut)

### Fixed

- Clang-format tool now supports multiple language specifications in the configuration file.
  The fix also allowed for increased unit test coverage of the tool. (@xydesa)

### Removed

- Support for Python 2.7, Python 3.4, and pypy.
- Required argument for `output_directory`.
  It is now an optional argument `output-directory` as described above.

## v0.2.15 - 2019-12-26

### Added

- Changed build and deploy Travis stages from Python 2.7 to Python 3.5.
- Unit tests for file dicovery now cover the case where the `file` command is not available.

### Fixed

- Bug found when using tool under Ubuntu 18.04 where the diff calculated for clang-format desired and actual
  configurations would produce empty lines.
  This caused the tool to throw an exception.
  Fixed by checking that there is diff output before trying to read it.
- The uncrustify unit test now works on Ubuntu Bionic.
- Several pylint issues related to unnecessary elif and else after break/continue/raise lines were cleaned up.

### Removed

## v0.2.14 - 2019-11-21

### Added

- Support for Python 3.8 (build and unit tests on Travis).
- Updated unit tests for main Statick module.

### Fixed

- Install patterns updated to prevent picking up the `plugin_mapping` directory multiple times. (@kkredit)
- Handle more varied output from pyflakes tool.

### Removed

- Removed support for previously deprecated pep8 and pep257 tools.
  The pycodestyle and pydocstyle tools provide the same functionality, only the tool name needs to change in the
  configuration file.

## v0.2.13 - 2019-09-22

### Added

- Python 3.8-dev is now part of the test matrix for Travis jobs.

## v0.2.12 - 2019-09-08
